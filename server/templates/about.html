	Judging by the immense number of poisonous YouTube comments there is a strong demand for them. We exist to satisfy that demand on every other website on the internet. Commentary brings  YouTube comments to the world.
      </p><br><p>
	We reach this goal through a Chrome extension, which allows users to easily comment anything on any webpage, and view other users comments as well. The user simply has to type a comment into the text box and click send comment for the whole web to view their thoughts.
      </p><br><p>
	Future versions may include  upvoting and downvoting capabilities as well as a live update of the running Commentary feed for each webpage.
